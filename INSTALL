For 'normal' installation see README.

If you're working on the installation scripts/makefiles etc. then
there's a script to clean out the directory before running Automake.

$ ./make_clean_for_autotools.sh				[*]

and then proceed as in the README with something like

$ autoreconf --install
$ perl Makefile.PL
or maybe for testing
$ perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/home/user/junk
$ cp Makefile Makefile.real				[**]
$ make
$ make test
If you're installing in a user location
$ make -f Makefile.real pure_install
or if you're feeling adventurous as root
# make -f Makefile.real pure_install

[*] This really ought to be 'make distclean' or something like that.
[**] Sorry, a horrible hack (the C source files etc. should be in ./src/).

Hopefully Cmake will replace Autotools in the not too distant future,
so the Autotools build stuff can all be junked.
