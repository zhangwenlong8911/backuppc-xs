  VERSION 0.63:
  - Remove the bundled zlib, which has security issues.
  - Replace 'configure.sh' by 'configure'.  Original file remains for reference
    and probably still works.
  - To comply with GNU terms (and to satisfy Red Hat), include source sufficient
    to use GNU autotools to create the 'configure' script.
  - Silence a bunch of warnings.
