BackupPC-XS version 0.63
========================

BackupPC::XS implements various BackupPC functions in a perl-callable
module.

This version of the module is REQUIRED by all versions of BackupPC
later than version 4.4.0, i.e. by version 4.4.1rc1 and later.

This version is NOT for use with BackupPC versions 4.4.0 and earlier.

INSTALLATION  (See also 'INSTALL'.)

To install this module please use a shell to execute the following
commands after first unpacking the tarball - or alternatively after
'git clone'- and 'cd'ing to the source directory.  You do not type the
'$' and '#' symbols - they indicate that you are running the shell as
either an unprivileged user (the '$' symbol) or as user 'root' (the #
symbol).  The 'su' command will request the root password of course.

  $ autoreconf --install
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ cp Makefile Makefile.real
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ su
  # make -f Makefile.real pure_install

If you have any problems, please post to the BackupPC Users' Mailing List.
